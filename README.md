# Roommates-Cloud-Functions

Welcome to the **Roommates-Cloud-Functions** repository. This project provides a set of cloud functions designed to power the Roommates App, enabling shared household management through Firestore and Google Cloud. These functions allow roommates to create groups, send and accept invites, assign and track chores, and manage shared responsibilities in a collaborative and transparent way.

## Overview

In this repository, youâ€™ll find detailed documentation on how to deploy and manage our APIs using Google Cloud Functions. Our functions support creating groups, managing invites, adding and rotating chores, and handling reminders. Additionally, we provide Firestore triggers to automate workflows such as updating chore assignments, tracking completion, and sending notifications.

## Key Features

- **Group Management**: Functions to create and manage groups of roommates.  
- **Invites System**: Functions to invite new members to a group and track their responses.  
- **Chore Management**: Functions for creating chores, assigning tasks, setting reminders, and tracking completion status.  
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Deployment instructions for launching serverless functions with minimal configuration.  
- **Firestore Integration**: Subcollections for chores, members, and events that keep household data organized and queryable.  
- **Reminders & Scheduling**: Support for chore recurrence (daily, weekly, monthly) and push notifications for reminders.  

## Roadmap for Growth

This project is designed to **grow over time**. The features above represent the foundation, but future updates will expand functionality, including:  

- **Groceries & Shopping Lists**: Shared lists for tracking needed items.  
- **Bills & Expenses**: Tools to log bills, set due dates, and divide costs automatically.  
- **Events & House Rules**: Calendar integration for events, quiet hours, or house policies.  
- **Analytics & Dashboards**: Visual summaries of chores completed, bills paid, or contributions by each member.  
- **Enhanced Notifications**: Smarter reminders, escalations for overdue tasks, and cross-platform delivery.  

As the Roommates App matures, these cloud functions will continue to evolve to meet the needs of real shared households.
